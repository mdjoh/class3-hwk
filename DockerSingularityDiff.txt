Docker and Singularity serve the same purpose to run containers with an application and its components in said containers that can run on any machines.
Docker is easy to use to scale and update components and is well-supported by the community and has official support releases.
Singularity complements Docker and is able to run Docker images when Docker is not installed and can limit a user's privileges unlike Docker. Singularity is said to be favoured in high-performance computing.
